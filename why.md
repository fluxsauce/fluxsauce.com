## Why

I design, contribute to, and support many websites that offer rich, multimedia experiences across many devices. Technologies and site features are driven by audiences, business, marketing, and so forth, and those requirements are all valid.

Upon reflection, I barely used the analytics and realized practically no revenue from ad tools that were on my personal sites for more than a decade. I used an enterprise-grade content management system that requires constant updating to manage a handful of pages that rarely change. I loaded assets from multiple domains I don't control to deliver content that doesn't require it.

I've reconsidered my requirements. I switched to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), an open-source static site generator, and wrote a template from scratch.

I was inspired by [Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/) and [Motherfucking Website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/).
